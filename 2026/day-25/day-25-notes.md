# Day 25 – Git Reset vs Revert & Branching Strategies

## Task 1: Git Reset

* What happens with git reset --soft?

  Moves HEAD back one commit.

  Removes commit from history.

  Keeps all changes staged.

  Ready to commit again.

* What happens with git reset --mixed?

  Moves HEAD back one commit.

  Removes commit from history.
  
  Keeps changes in working directory.

  Changes become unstaged.

* What happens with git reset --hard?

  Moves HEAD back one commit.

  Removes commit from history.

  Deletes all changes permanently.

* Difference Between --soft, --mixed, and --hard
  
  --soft → Removes commit but keeps changes staged.
  
  --mixed → Removes commit and keeps changes unstaged.

  --hard → Removes commit and deletes changes completely.

* Which One Is Destructive?

  git reset --hard
  
  Permanently removes commits and working directory changes.

* When Would You Use Each One?
  
  --soft → Modify commit message or combine commits.

  --mixed → Reorganize files before committing again.

  --hard → Discard unwanted local changes.

* Should You Use Reset on Pushed Commits?

  No. It rewrites history and can cause conflicts for collaborators.


## Task 2: Git Revert

* What Happens When Reverting Commit Y?
  
  Git creates a new commit.

  The new commit reverses the changes made by commit Y.

  Commit Y remains in history.

* Is Commit Y Still in History?
  Yes.
  Git Revert preserves history.
 
* Difference Between Reset and Revert
  
  git reset rewrites history and removes commits.

  git revert preserves history and creates an undo commit.

* Why Is Revert Safer?
  
  History remains intact.

  Safe for shared repositories.

  No force push required.

* When To Use Revert vs Reset?

  Use Revert for shared or pushed commits.

  Use Reset for local commits that haven't been pushed.


## Task 3: Reset vs Revert Comparison

| Feature | git reset | git revert |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| What it does | Rewrites history and removes commits | Creates a new commit that undoes changes |
| Removes commit history | Yes | No |
| Creates new commit | No | Yes |
| Safe for shared branches | No | Yes |
| Best use case | Local cleanup | Undo pushed commits |


## Task 4: Branching Strategies

### Git Flow 

The workflow revolves around two **permanent main branches** and **three temporary supporting branches**

```bash

                    ► [ feature/* ] ──┐
                    /                   ▼
[ main ] ──► [ develop ] ───────────► [ release/* ] ──► [ main ] (Release)
   │                                                       │
   └──────► [ hotfix/* ] ──────────────────────────────────┴──► [ develop ] (Sync)

```

### Permanent Main branches

main (formerly master) -- Holds official production-ready release history.

develop -- Acts as the integration branch for all new features.

### Temporary supporting branches

feature/* -- Used to develop new features or major enhancements. (branches off develop)

release/* -- Prepares a completed development cycle for production deployment. (branches off develop)

hotfix/* -- Swiftly addresses critical bugs discovered in live production. (branches off main)


Pros

* Structured workflow.
* Clear release process.  
* Suitable for large teams.
  
Cons

* Complex.
* More branch management.
  
Used For
* Enterprise teams.
* Scheduled releases.

### GitHub Flow

How It Works

* Single main branch.
* Create feature branch.
* Open Pull Request.
* Review and merge back to main.
  
Pros

* Simple.
* Fast deployment.
* Easy to learn.

Cons

* Less release control.

Used For

* Startups.
* Continuous deployment.

### Trunk-Based Development

How It Works

* Developers work on short-lived branches.
* Merge changes frequently into main.
* Main branch always stays deployable.

Pros
* Fast development.
* Supports CI/CD.
* Fewer merge conflicts.

Cons
* Requires strong testing.

## Which Strategy Would You Use for a Startup Shipping Fast?

Trunk-Based Development

Reason:

* Fast feedback.
* Rapid delivery.
* Minimal branching overhead.
  
## Which Strategy Would You Use for a Large Team with Scheduled Releases?

GitFlow

Reason:

* Better release management.
* Clear separation of development and production.
  
## Which Strategy Does an Open Source Project Use?
Kubernetes

* Uses a Trunk-Based/GitHub Flow style workflow.
* Main branch for active development.
* Release branches for stable versions.

## Git Reflog

What Is Git Reflog?

Records all HEAD movements.
Tracks resets, commits, checkouts, and merges.

Why Is It Useful?

* Recover lost commits.
* Undo accidental hard resets.
* Restore deleted work.

Example

git reflog

git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
